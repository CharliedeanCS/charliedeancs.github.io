        <h3></h3>
        <div>The wait is over – it’s time to start your dream trip with Camp Sri Lanka! Sitting snug in South Asia, Sri Lanka is a stunning country bejewelled in natural beauty; you won’t want to waste a minute in this majestic haven, so we’ll meet the coordinator at 9:00am for an induction and information session to get the essential information out of the way! There are elements of Sri Lankan culture that will differ slightly from what you’re used to at home, so you’ll be given useful tips about local culture, as well as information about Kandy, a city located in central Sri Lanka where you’ll be staying during your visit to Sri Lanka. Following the induction, prepare for a day brimming with excitement, with a language class and cultural show arranged for you and the rest of the group. As is the case in many countries, a willingness to try and to speak in the native tongue when possible is appreciated, so enjoy the session and take in as much as possible during the lesson – a basic understanding of the language will come in handy during your trip and enhance your overall experience at Camp Sri Lanka! In the evening, you’ll be given the opportunity to refine your language skills at a language class, during which time you’ll be given a riveting insight about the origins of the local language.</div>

        <h3></h3>
        <div>Ready to delve deeper into the delights of Sri Lanka? After breakfast, we’ll meet the coordinator at 9:00am and prepare for a day basking in in the midst of some of the most phenomenal sites in the region. Ayurveda medicines have origins stretching 3,000 years, having originally derived in India; the healing system has since been adopted within Sri Lankan civilisation, and today we’ll be visiting a garden where the medicine is developed. Sri Lanka is also known for its culinary master class, with a repertoire of dishes, with the likes of kottu roti, a stir-fry comprising meat, vegetables and roti (bread) and a range of curries doused with a host of delicious spices. We’ll visit where these spices are made and also visit a tea factory and gem museum. Hinduism is a religious practice adopted throughout Sri Lanka. Before returning back to the centre, we’ll visit a Hindu temple, the place of worship. When visiting a Hindu temple, there is etiquette that must be adhered to – this is a place of worship and a sacred location, so be sure to wear respectful clothing and remove your shoes before entering. During your visit, the priest may offer you items; anything offered should be accepted with your right hand – avoid giving or receiving items with your left hand.</div>

<center><h23>Something to consider</h23></center>
<p>Camp Thailand is not a typical idea of a holiday and it’s not always relaxing; at times you may find yourself in testing circumstances, as you would when experiencing any new culture. There may be bad weather, mosquitos, long journeys, slow Wi-Fi and limited food options.</p>
<p>However, here at Camp Thailand, we thoroughly enjoy stepping out of the comfort zone, embracing new cultures and learning how people live in other countries! Every year, we have a fantastic time, as have thousands of previous Camp Thailand attendees. Though we personally love the experience, we realise that it may not be everyone’s cup of tea. As such, prior to your application, please make sure that you understand that this is a cultural experience, not a luxury holiday; our aim is to make a positive impact in the community – this is a product of hard work and dedication!</p>
<p>While we cannot guarantee that you will have a relaxing time, we fully recommend that you come to Camp Thailand with a sense of adventure and a willingness to embrace the experience – ultimately, there is only one person who will dictate how much you enjoy camp and that’s you! We provide the setup and infrastructure for you to have a genuinely incredible time that many would love to be involved with; the rest of the package comes from you and your commitment to the cause.</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that our best participants on the program immerse themselves in the activities each day; if you work with passion, your enthusiasm will not only be appreciated by us here at Camp Thailand, but the locals who you are helping will be grateful for your help. We present the opportunity to partake in some of the most unbelievable life experiences, including visiting communities in local schools and getting up close and personal with Thailand’s elephants, while making friends for life.</p>
