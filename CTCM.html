<center><h23>Something to consider</h23></center>
<p>Camp Thailand is not a typical idea of a holiday and it’s not always relaxing; at times you may find yourself in testing circumstances, as you would when experiencing any new culture. There may be bad weather, mosquitos, long journeys, slow Wi-Fi and limited food options.</p>
<p>However, here at Camp Thailand, we thoroughly enjoy stepping out of the comfort zone, embracing new cultures and learning how people live in other countries! Every year, we have a fantastic time, as have thousands of previous Camp Thailand attendees. Though we personally love the experience, we realise that it may not be everyone’s cup of tea. As such, prior to your application, please make sure that you understand that this is a cultural experience, not a luxury holiday; our aim is to make a positive impact in the community – this is a product of hard work and dedication!</p>
<p>While we cannot guarantee that you will have a relaxing time, we fully recommend that you come to Camp Thailand with a sense of adventure and a willingness to embrace the experience – ultimately, there is only one person who will dictate how much you enjoy camp and that’s you! We provide the setup and infrastructure for you to have a genuinely incredible time that many would love to be involved with; the rest of the package comes from you and your commitment to the cause.</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that our best participants on the program immerse themselves in the activities each day; if you work with passion, your enthusiasm will not only be appreciated by us here at Camp Thailand, but the locals who you are helping will be grateful for your help. We present the opportunity to partake in some of the most unbelievable life experiences, including visiting communities in local schools and getting up close and personal with Thailand’s elephants, while making friends for life.</p>

<center><h23>FAQs</h23></center>
<button class="accordion" >Am I responsible for booking my own flights?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Applicants for the Camp Thailand program are responsible for booking flights. We have an amazing in-house flights team at HQ devoted to helping you find the best very offers for your trip! To speak with a member of the team, call +441613123459 or email flights@invasion.com</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What sort of accommodation will I be staying in at Camp Thailand?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>You will stay in a bright and airy, bunk bedded room typically with 3-5 other people (of the same gender as yourself) sharing the room. We also have a couple of dorm style rooms which house up to 12 people.</p>

<p>Most of the rooms are fan cooled and in some locations they will have Air con. During most months of the year Thailand has a tropical climate and the Summer months are much hotter and more humid than the winter months.</p>

<p>Most Camp Thailand participants think that it is more fun to stay in the bunk bedded rooms with their new friends – but if you are travelling with a partner and wish to have more privacy you may wish to consider your own private room for the duration of your stay. To discuss this further, please contact the office.</p>

<p>Additional information will be provided during your pre-departure orientation meeting at our Manchester HQ.</p>

<button class="accordion">Is Camp Thailand for everyone? (Something to consider)</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Camp Thailand is not everyone’s idea of a holiday and it’s not always relaxing. At times you may find yourself in testing circumstances, as you would when experiencing any new culture. There may be bad weather, mosquitos, long journeys, slow wifi and limited food options. However, here at Camp Thailand, we believe that is what comes with stepping out of your comfort zone and into the unknown. We love it, as have thousands of previous Camp Thailand attendees. However, we realise that it may not be everyone’s cup of tea.</p>
  <p>Before applying to take part in Camp Thailand, please understand that it’s a cultural experience. It isn’t a luxury holiday, and one of our main focuses is to make a positive impact, which often comes with hard work. We can not guarantee you will have a nice relaxing time. You have to come to Camp Thailand with a sense of adventure, go with the flow and be laid back. Basically, YOU are the deciding factor in the experience you have at Camp Thailand. We provide the setup and infrastructure for you to have an incredible experience. However, that is only half of it. The other half comes from you. Your passion to help others, your spirit to do something different, your ability to make friends and go with the flow. You get out what you put in and if you give it your all, together we will have an amazing experience at Camp Thailand. We can teach communities in local schools, get up close and personal with Thailand’s elephants, make friends for life and get involved in some incredible activities.
  </p>
  <p>I guess the question now… is Camp Thailand for you!?</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is Wi-Fi available at Camp Thailand?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Yes, Wi-Fi is available, whether it be in a communal area or in your room. However, we try our best to ensure that Wi-Fi is available in most areas of your accommodation. </p>

  <p>Additional information will be provided during your pre-departure orientation meeting at our Manchester HQ</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Do we have access to cooking facilities or a kitchen at Camp?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>In Thailand most people live in dwellings without kitchens as cheap, fresh and delicious food is available everywhere. Popular Western food choices are also available here. At all our Camps we have 7/11 shops that are open 24 hours, plus other convenience stores within a five minute walk of the accommodation. There are also a large number of eating establishments in the immediate vicinity of your Camp Thailand location.
  </p>
  <p>Additional information will be provided during your pre-departure orientation meeting at our Manchester HQ.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Are meals at Camp Thailand included in the program fee?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The meals that are included are the delicious lunches that are provided by the Thai schools on the days you are teaching there. Please note that in some cases we will be in the schools for under two hours and in the cases of temple schools and orphanages they don’t have the budget to provide lunch. Don’t worry though, there is an abundance of inexpensive, fresh and delicious food from the many food stands and small family restaurants.
  </p>
  <p>You can buy cheap, delicious and healthy Thai food for breakfast from many of the local street vendors in the surrounding area.
  </p>
  <p>Additional information will be provided during your pre-departure orientation meeting at our Manchester HQ.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">
Are there washing machines on hand at our accommodation?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>For about 1.20 GBP per kilo (approx. 2.25 lbs) local laundry services will wash your clothes early morning and return them washed and neatly pressed the following afternoon.
  </p>
  <p>Additional information will be provided during your pre-departure orientation meeting at our Manchester HQ.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Do I get any free time at Camp?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>You will get at least one day off a week (usually at the weekends). However, we run activities on your days off. You’re usually only in the schools for around 4-6 hours a day, leaving the rest of the afternoon to explore and partake in weekly activities or explore the local area.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Will I get time to travel after Camp?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Certainly! With so many amazing places in Thailand we encourage this! You can travel on your own or join our Island Hopping Tour! Each member of our team is well traveled and have visited Thailand many times, so we are always happy to give you travel advice.
  </p>
    <p>Additional information will be provided during your pre-departure orientation meeting at our Manchester HQ.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How much spending money will I need?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Thailand is very cheap, and it depends how well you can, or need to budget. For further advice contact our team and we can help you come up with an idea how much you will need to budget for. There are also opportunities to do additional activities which you may want to budget for.
  </p>
  <p>Additional information will be provided during your pre-departure orientation meeting at our Manchester HQ.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Will I make friends at Camp Thailand?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Definitely! You will be making friends from the moment you land in Bangkok, friends you will keep for life after sharing such an amazing experience.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What should I pack for Camp Thailand?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>You will receive a packing list as part of the ‘Pre-Departure pack’ which you will be sent prior to leaving for Camp, but here’s just a few items we recommend taking;</p>
  <p>– Mosquito spray</p>
  <p>– Sun cream</p>
  <p>– Warm weather clothing</p>
  <p>– A padlock</p>
  <p>– A camera to capture all your amazing experiences</p>
  <p>– You will also want to bring your own towel and washcloth as only bed linens are provided at Camp</p>
  <p>Additional information will be provided during your pre-departure orientation meeting at our Manchester HQ</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Should I bring a suitcase or a backpack for Camp Thailand?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The choice is yours, but a backpack is definitely more suitable for travelling around Thailand. Plus, you don’t want to look like a starry-eyed first time traveller dragging around a heavy suitcase, looking like you just landed at a 5* resort in Europe!</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Do I need a passport and a visa?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Passport: A full passport valid for the duration of your stay is required. Please check that you still have at least 6 months left in your passport from the time you arrive in Thailand.
  </p><p>
    Visa: For visitors from most Western countries that are arriving in Thailand by air and are staying for 30 days or less, no visa is normally required to be obtained prior to arrival. For visitors from most Western countries that are arriving in Thailand by sea or land, only a 15 day visa will be granted. So, if you are a visitor from a Western country, arriving by air and planning on staying in Thailand continuously for over 30 days, or arriving in Thailand by land or sea you will need to apply for a tourist visa from your nearest Thai consulate. A single entry, 60 day tourist visa allows you to stay in Thailand for 60 days and can be extended from within Thailand just before expiration for a further 30 days at an additional cost of 1,900 THB. If you are planning on doing the Cambodia trip, or any other travel to other countries while you are here in Asia and then coming back to Thailand you are best advised to apply for a double entry, 60 day tourist visa.
  </p><p>
    Please note that you can google the address of your nearest Thai consulate and then download the forms online from the consulate to apply for the tourist visa. The stated purpose of your visit will be tourism only. You can then simply follow the application process provided in the online forms by the consulate and apply in person or through the mail. If applying in person you need to submit your forms and documentation on a weekday, normally before noon local time and then collect your passport with visa the following afternoon, normally after 2 p.m. local time.
  </p><p>
    Please note that the rules for visas often change and we are not liable for this. Your visa is your responsibility and we have no control or influence over the Royal Thai Consulate.
  </p><p>
    Additional information will be provided during your pre-departure orientation meeting at our Manchester HQ.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What else do I need for Camp Thailand?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Personal Insurance, covering the time you will be in Thailand plus any activities that you will be undertaking, as well as any planned travel to other countries.</p>

  <p>A DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) Check. If you are a U.K. national, Camp Thailand will arrange your DBS check for you for a fee of £48.86. If you are coming from another country you will need to contact your local police department and initiate the process yourself to get the DBS equivalent from your country. If you are from another country and would like some guidance, feel free to call our office on 0161 222 3780. Please note that even if you already hold a DBS certificate, unfortunately we must still conduct our own check.</p>

  <p>Additional information will be provided during your pre-departure orientation meeting at our Manchester HQ.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What should I wear when I am working in a school?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>You should wear your Camp Thailand polo shirt in the schools. One will be issued to you as part of your program fee. However, you may want to purchase one or more of these shirts at a cost of 12.50 GBP each, as you will be visiting the schools for up to 4 days during any given week, meaning that there will not be enough time for cleaning if you only have one shirt. If you don’t wish to wear the polo shirt, men will need to wear smart collared, buttoned shirt, short or long sleeves and     women will need to wear blouses with capped shoulders and no plunging necklines.</p>

  <p>When in classrooms, men are normally required to wear long smart trousers. Women have the choice of long, smart slacks, a full length dress with capped shoulders and no plunging neckline, or a knee length skirt with a blouse with capped shoulder and no plunging necklines.</p>

  <p>When visiting Mini-English Summer Camps, the only approved top for men and women is the Camp Thailand Polo shirt.</p>

  <p>In the Mini-English Summer Camps men can wear long smart trousers or knee length trousers. Women can do the same, but trousers must be loose fitting rather than body-clinging and your polo shirt should be not tucked in if you are a female.</p>

    <p>Please remember you must wear capped toe shoes, and definitely no flip flops at school.</p>

    <p>All forms of body art (Tattoos) must be covered and body piercings must be removed. However, earrings can be kept in.</p>

    <p>You must remember that teachers are revered in Thailand and the children are brought up to respect the teachers. Whilst Thailand is very tolerant of all religions and cultures, and although you will see Thai people with tattoos and piercings, Thai society prefers its children not to be exposed to this, wherever possible, until they become young adults. If they choose to have tattoos or body piercings after they become adults that is a matter of personal freedom. This is, in reality, no different than in Western culture where there is legislation in place to limit smoking adverts/commercials or billboards at sporting events. Please do not take this request personally.</p>

    <p>Thai culture is very polite, respectful, conservative and modest. Please try to adapt and be respectful of all Thai culture. Please remember that you are a guest in this country and you should try to behave as you would if you were invited to someone’s home for the first time.</p>

    <p>Additional information will be provided during your pre-departure orientation meeting at our Manchester HQ.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What happens if I can’t come to Camp Thailand once I have booked my place?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We can defer your placement acceptance offer to a future intake date that must be initiated within 12 months from your original intake date. Please note that all deposits are non-refundable so you would be best advised to take out a travel insurance policy that will cover this if there is even a slight chance that you will not be coming to Camp Thailand.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is the program orientation that I have to attend?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>As part of your program participation, you will be required to attend a compulsory pre-departure orientation meeting held at our head office in Manchester, UK. Its an amazing way to meet the Camp Thailand Team and get a taste for what a day in our office is like. We will go over everything about Thailand and what you can expect so that you are fully prepared for the time of your life.</p>

  <p>Under extenuating circumstances, we are able to offer a Skype orientation at a time that suits you. This will be at a cost of £25. Please contact the office for more information.</p>
